export const aboutMe = `My name is Nicholas Stephenson. I build web applications using Rails 5, Angular 2+,  React/Redux, Bootstrap 4, PostgreSQL, Git, and Typescript, and I’m always adding more to my skillset or honing the effectiveness of my current tools. Outside of development, I’m a music and film junkie, I care deeply about public health and sustaining our environment, and you can catch me on any given Saturday volunteering in my community. Prior to my experience in development, I covered a variety of roles in the entertainment industry where I was constantly challenged to quickly adapt to new experiences and teams of people. I always look forward to taking on new challenges.`
